# Azure ETL & Data Engineering Project: Enterprise Data Pipeline Architecture

🚀 **Happy to Share My Azure ETL & Data Engineering Project!** 🚀

This project demonstrates the development of a fully automated data pipeline using **Microsoft Azure**, leveraging the **Medallion Architecture** to transform raw data into valuable insights. The solution is designed to handle large-scale data processing while ensuring data quality, governance, and scalability. 

---

## 📖 Introduction

The goal of this project was to design and implement a comprehensive data engineering solution that automates the process of ingesting, transforming, and visualizing data. The pipeline is built using Azure services such as **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Azure Data Lake Storage**, with a focus on scalability, automation, and data governance. By leveraging the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers), we can ensure a structured flow of data from raw ingestion to insights.

## 🛠 Architecture Overview

The architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern and is designed to handle large-scale data processing tasks in a structured and efficient manner.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from on-prem SQL databases and external sources is stored in Azure Data Lake.
2. **Silver Layer**: Data transformations are applied using Azure Databricks (PySpark) to clean and format data, making it suitable for analytics.
3. **Gold Layer**: Final, analytics-ready data is stored for easy querying and consumption by tools like Azure Synapse and Power BI.
